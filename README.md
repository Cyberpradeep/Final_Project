# Garbage Classification with MobileNetV2 (Transfer Learning)

**Author**: Cyberpradeep  
**Repo**: [Final_Project](https://github.com/Cyberpradeep/Final_Project)  
**Model**: Trained on 6 garbage types using MobileNetV2  
**Interface**: Gradio Web UI

---

## Objective

Build a deep learning model that can classify images of garbage into categories like:
- `cardboard`
- `glass`
- `metal`
- `paper`
- `plastic`
- `trash`

This promotes smart waste segregation, essential for environmental sustainability üåç‚ôªÔ∏è.

## Project Highlights

-  **Transfer Learning** with MobileNetV2 (`imagenet` weights)
- Trained with images organized into 6 class folders
- 224x224 image input, normalized and augmented
- Final `.h5` model saved in Google Drive
- Deployed with **Gradio** for real-time predictions

## Model Architecture

-  Base model: **MobileNetV2** (frozen during initial training)
-  Custom classifier head:
  - GlobalAveragePooling2D  
  - BatchNormalization  
  - Dense(128, relu) + Dropout  
  - Dense(10, softmax)
-  Optimizer: Adam
-  Loss: sparse_categorical_crossentropy
